       The anglerfish are bony fish because of it's characteristic, predation, which is a modified luminescent fin ray that luresn in other fish that are attracted to light. There are different types of anglerfish as well. The pelagic anglerfish dwell away for the seafloor while the benthic anglerfish dwell close to the seafloor. The anglerfish was first discovered in 1833 when a female anglerfish was found lying on the shore of greenland.
