    Did you know that only 80% of our earth's ocean has been explored? And before we even explore our oceans more are we already trying to colonise another planet? Well you never know what might be in the ocean, maybe some scary monsters or maybe a shipwreck from anncient times? In this website i'm going to show you what's really down deep into the ocean. It's fascinating for some people to know that there are more unknown places to explore and that means more descovering to be done.
